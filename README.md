# github-repository-scraping
This website made for help users to view Github repositories, without needing to open a github page (confused ? haha, it's just a tool you can tweak for scrapping data from other websites).

Created using:
- Boostrap 3
- Boostrap DataTable
- JQUERY 3

Github pages only allow static pages, which means html files work, but not PHP. So please download and run it on localhost or on your webhosting.
